# Radio-of-Rock
A PWA built for to listen to my favourite radio streamings. 

## Objective
I built the first approach to a PWA that able me to load or save my favourites URL radio streams, to listen to radio without the neccesity to charge a website in a web browser.

### PWA Features
This is the Roadmap of this PWA. I will adding slowly all the features detailed here, but w/o a deadline specific. Just when I have a free time to code it.

* Integrate Wake Lock API to avoid the screensaver in a computer or a mobile device who is using this PWA.
* Integrate Media Session API to control the JS audio Object of its PWA using directly the mobile's or desktop's Notification Centre.
* Use of serviceworker to install and use it w/o website dependences.
